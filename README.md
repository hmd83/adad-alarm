This  project aims to solve the problems faced by firefighters when fighting forest fires, which can grow quickly and unpredictably due to various factors. One major issue is that there isn't a good way to share important information quickly in forest areas. The project suggests a new solution using special detectors that use the Helium LoRa network to send data to fix this. The detectors have CubeCell-dev boards, LoRa modules, and BME680 Gas sensors that measure humidity, temperature, and gas emissions. The data is sent to Node-RED through the Helium network using MQTT Protocol and stored in an SQL Database. By noticing smoke and gas from wildfires early on, my project can detect fires very early, in less than 30 minutes. This gives firefighters more time to stop fires before they get too spread.
